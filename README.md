By implementing a multi-level menu, the application ensures seamless navigation through related content, providing users with an engaging and organized experience.

With a focus on **user-centered design**, **responsive interfaces**, and **modern development practices**, this project delivers an elegant solution for exploring cricket-related data dynamically. It also emphasizes accessibility and scalability, demonstrating best practices in web development.

## Key Features

### 1. Nested Routing

At the heart of this project is its implementation of nested routing using React Router. This structure allows users to delve deeper into content while maintaining a cohesive browsing experience. For instance:

- Users can view a list of cricket teams.

- Clicking on a team navigates to its details page, displaying information about the captain, coach, championships won, and more. 

- Additional nested routes provide access to players associated with the team and their individual profiles. 

- Match schedules and details are also available, organized hierarchically under a separate section.

This hierarchical navigation ensures that users can explore related content intuitively, enhancing their overall experience.

## 2. Responsive Design

The application uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to ensure responsiveness and a polished user interface. The design adapts seamlessly to various devices, including:

- Mobile phones for on-the-go browsing.

- Tablets for intermediate screen sizes.

- Desktops for an immersive experience.

- Key responsive elements include:

- Grid-based layouts for structured content.

- Adaptive menus that transform into a collapsible hamburger menu on smaller screens.

- Consistent typography and spacing across all devices.

##3. Dynamic Content Rendering

- The application leverages Reactâ€™s component-based architecture to render content dynamically. Features include:
