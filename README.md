Nested Routing: A React Application for Cricket Enthusiasts

## Overview
 
The "Nested Routing" project is a sophisticated web application developed using React,
designed to showcase the power and flexibility of nested routing with React Router. This
application focuses on the world of cricket, allowing users to access detailed information about
cricket teams, players, and matches. By structuring the application to support a multi-level
menu, users can easily navigate through related content, enhancing their overall experience.
The project aims to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface while demonstrating
modern web development practices and principles.

## Key Features

### Nested Routing

 - At the core of this project is the implementation of nested routing, which is crucial for creating a
 seamless user experience. The application’s routing structure is designed to enable users to
 delve deeper into content without navigating away from the main page. For example, users can
 click on a team to view its details, such as the captain, coach, and championships won. This
 hierarchical approach not only keeps the interface organized but also allows users to explore
 related information quickly and efficiently.

 Responsive Design

  The project employs Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring that the application is fully responsive.
 Tailwind’s utility-first CSS framework allows for the creation of a visually appealing layout that
 adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
