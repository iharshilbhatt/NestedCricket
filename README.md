## Key Features

### 1. Nested Routing

At the heart of this project is its implementation of nested routing using React Router. This structure allows users to delve deeper into content while maintaining a cohesive browsing experience. For instance:

<ol>Users can view a list of cricket teams.</ol>

<ol>Clicking on a team navigates to its details page, displaying information about the captain, coach, championships won, and more. </ol>  

<ol>Additional nested routes provide access to players associated with the team and their individual profiles. </ol>

<ol>Match schedules and details are also available, organized hierarchically under a separate section.</ol>

This hierarchical navigation ensures that users can explore related content intuitively, enhancing their overall experience.
